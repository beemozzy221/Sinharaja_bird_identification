# Sinharaja bird annotation project

This is a deep learning project involved for identifying birds which are endemic to Sri Lanka and are found in Sinharaja forest. The project is under construction as the annotation of the sound files are currently underway.

If you would like to annotate bird sound files, feel free to give a message to: beemozzy221@gmail.com
