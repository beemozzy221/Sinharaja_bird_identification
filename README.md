# Sinharaja bird annotation project

This is a deep learning project involved for identifying birds which are endemic to Sri Lanka and are found in Sinharaja forest. 
The project is under construction as the annotation of the sound files are currently underway.

If you would like to annotate bird sound files, feel free to give a message to: beemozzy221@gmail.com

Sample training can be conducted. The relevant feature and target files (for EATO based on Zenodo annotation from https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecy.3329) 
can be found in: 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_1RKyb_hvWy3Th_4gzQ-zmQLfctAOC7a?usp=sharing

Once the folders are placed in the directory, the trainmodel.py should be run to train the model.
